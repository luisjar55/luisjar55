- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @luisjar55
- I am a contributor to LJ Design Studios for the trd.ljdesignstudios.com program that creates open source fonts.
- Our mission is to provide resources (Under this TRD division) that can be used freely by the community.
- NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH LJDS (this field requires acquiring a commercial license)
- TRD Offers open source projects, where new collaborators are invited:
    * Download, modify and create alternatives.
    * Reuse open source projects for free purposes.

You can check the information at https://trd.ljdesignstudios.com and learn more about this contribution project.
